    """Mantel-Haenszel DIF sweep for dichotomous items (compute in Rust; Holland & Thayer, 1988).

    Examinees are stratified by an observed matching score (the number-correct total, including the
    studied item by default -- the ETS standard, less biased than the rest score per Donoghue, Holland
    & Thayer, 1993; set ``exclude_studied_item=True`` to match on the rest score). For each item, at
    every matching level a ``2 x 2`` table of group (reference/focal) by response (correct/incorrect) is
    formed, and over the DIF-informative strata (all four marginal totals positive):

    - ``alpha_mh`` is the Mantel-Haenszel common odds ratio;
    - ``chi2_mh`` is the continuity-corrected MH chi-square, referred to ``chi2(1)`` for ``p_value``;
    - ``mh_d_dif`` is the ETS delta-metric statistic ``-2.35 ln(alpha_mh)`` (negative = harder for the
      focal group) with the Robins-Breslow-Greenland (1986) standard error ``se_d_dif``;
    - ``ets_class`` is the ETS ``"A"`` (negligible) / ``"B"`` (moderate) / ``"C"`` (large) severity
      classification (Zieky, 1993), or ``"U"`` when the statistic is undefined (no DIF-informative
      strata or a degenerate odds ratio);
    - ``std_p_dif`` is the standardized P-DIF (Dorans & Kulick, 1986), the focal-minus-reference
      focal-weighted proportion-correct difference (an effect size whose sign agrees with ``mh_d_dif``);
    - ``flagged_bh`` is the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR rejection at ``fdr_q`` on ``p_value``.

    Because MH is an observed-score procedure, its chi-square is over-powered at large N and the studied
    item's presence in the matching total mildly contaminates the criterion; the ``ets_class`` A/B/C
    rule (which requires ``|mh_d_dif| >= 1.0`` for a non-A flag) is the practical-significance guard
    against spuriously flagging clean items. MH detects *uniform* DIF and can miss crossing
    (non-uniform) DIF that the parametric IRT-LR test catches.

    ``responses`` is a persons x items ``0/1`` array (no missing data; drop or impute beforehand).
    ``group`` is a length-persons array with ``0`` = reference and ``1`` = focal (both must be present).
    Returns per-item NumPy arrays keyed as above; NaN statistics / ``"U"`` mark items with no
    DIF-informative strata or a degenerate common odds ratio.

    (Wang & Su, 2004).

    Mantel-Haenszel's crossing-DIF blind spot is inherited and purification cannot repair it: an item MH
    does not flag stays in the anchor every round and keeps contaminating the criterion. The blindness is
    a property of the SIGNED AREA between the two curves over the matched ability distribution, not of
    non-uniform DIF as such — a crossing at the centre of that distribution cancels and is invisible,
    while the same item with its crossing off centre is detected. Prefer :func:`logistic_dif_purified`
    when non-uniform DIF is plausible.

    """Uniform SIBTEST for dichotomous items (compute in Rust; Shealy & Stout, 1993).

    The third observed-score DIF procedure in this module, and the only one that corrects the MATCHING
    CRITERION itself. :func:`mantel_haenszel_dif` and :func:`logistic_dif` both match on an observed
    number-correct score, which is unreliable: under IMPACT (a genuine group difference in ability) two
    examinees from different groups with the same OBSERVED score do not have the same expected TRUE
    score, because each regresses toward their own group's mean. Matching on the raw score therefore
    compares non-equivalent examinees and manufactures DIF for items that have none. Item purification
    cannot substitute for this — it changes which items are in the criterion, not the regression of true
    score on observed score, so even a perfectly purified criterion stays biased.

    SIBTEST transports each group's conditional mean from that group's own Kelley-regressed true score
    to a common target (the unweighted midpoint of the two) before comparing. Each item in turn is the
    studied subtest; the valid subtest is every OTHER item, always disjoint — that is a property of the
    estimator, not an option.

    Returns per-item arrays: ``beta_uni`` (the regression-corrected weighted mean difference),
    ``se_beta``, ``b_uni``, ``p_value`` (``b_uni**2`` referred to ``chi2(1)``), ``alpha_ref`` and
    ``alpha_focal`` (the per-group reliabilities the correction divides by — a low or unstable alpha
    inflates the correction, so they are reported rather than hidden), ``n_strata_used``, ``flagged_bh``.

    **SIGN WARNING.** ``beta_uni > 0`` means the item is harder for the FOCAL group. This is the
    OPPOSITE orientation to ``mh_d_dif`` and ``std_p_dif`` from :func:`mantel_haenszel_dif`, which go
    negative in that same situation. The orientation is kept rather than harmonised because published
    ``|beta_uni|`` cut-offs assume it; flip one of the two when comparing across procedures.

    **When to prefer it — rarely, on the evidence measured here.** This implementation was compared
    against :func:`mantel_haenszel_dif` on identical simulated data, 500 replications per cell, 2PL,
    with NO DIF planted so every rejection is a false positive::

        impact  n per group  items   MH Type I   SIBTEST Type I
        0.0     1000         5       .044        .056
        1.0     1000         5       .046        .086

    These are the exact cells the shipped Monte-Carlo regression test runs and the rates it prints, so
    the table is regenerable from the repository rather than quoted from a study that no longer exists.

    SIBTEST over-rejects in both cells and by roughly DOUBLE under impact — the opposite of the ordering
    the motivation above might suggest. The cause is the standard error, below. This is not a
    transcription error (the closed-form anchors reproduce the reference implementation exactly); it is
    a property of the 1993 estimator, and it is what Jiang and Stout's (1998) paper — "Improved Type I
    error control and reduced estimation bias for DIF detection using SIBTEST" — exists to fix. Prefer
    :func:`mantel_haenszel_dif` or :func:`logistic_dif` for routine screening; reach for this when you
    specifically want the regression-corrected estimand, and read ``beta_uni`` as an effect size rather
    than trusting ``p_value`` as a calibrated test.

    **Limitations, none of them silent.** ``se_beta`` treats the regression correction as FIXED, so it
    does not propagate the correction's own estimation error; it is optimistic and the test
    over-rejects, as measured above. The shipped correction is the single linear one; Jiang and Stout's
    (1998) two-segment version is a different, later estimator and is not implemented. No guessing
    correction. No effect-size letter class: published cut-offs disagree and none was verified against a
    primary source, so the raw effect size ships uncalibrated.
    Crossing (non-uniform) DIF is NOT covered — Chalmers (2018) shows the Li and Stout (1996) crossing
    test is insufficient and no normal-theory referral is valid, so use :func:`logistic_dif`, whose
    ``S x G`` interaction tests crossing directly.

    **Provenance.** The formulas are transcribed from the reference implementation (Chalmers, 2012;
    the ``SIBTEST`` routine of the ``mirt`` package), which attributes them to Shealy and Stout (1993).
    The primary text was not consulted, and ``mirt`` was not executed — the transcription was made by
    reading its source, so the closed-form tests verify this code against the transcribed formulas and
    no agreement with ``mirt`` output is claimed.

    ``responses`` is a persons x items ``0/1`` array (no missing data) with at least 3 items; ``group``
    is length-persons with ``0`` = reference and ``1`` = focal. ``j_min`` (default 5) is the number of
    examinees per group per matching level that must be STRICTLY exceeded for that level to count.

    Unlike the observed-score procedures in this module (:func:`mantel_haenszel_dif`,
    :func:`logistic_dif`, :func:`sibtest`), this is a PARAMETRIC test on separately calibrated 2PL
    (or common-guessing 3PL) item parameter estimates: it measures the area between the reference and
    focal groups' item characteristic curves. The two calibrations MUST already be on a common scale --
    link them first (e.g. :func:`fast_mlsirm.irt_link` with the mean-sigma method); linking is
    deliberately not re-done inside this function.

    Under ``P_G(theta) = 1 / (1 + exp(-a_G (theta - b_G)))``:

    - Signed area (``signed=True``): ``h = b_foc - b_ref`` -- the integral of ``P_ref - P_foc`` over
      theta, POSITIVE when the item is harder for the focal group. Exact linear statistic; its Z test
      holds the nominal level (Monte-Carlo verified in the crate's test suite).
    - Unsigned area (``signed=False``, default): ``h = |H|``, the total area
      ``integral |P_foc - P_ref|``, from Raju's closed form with a numerically stable softplus; equal
      discriminations fall back to ``|b_foc - b_ref|`` continuously. CAVEAT: under an exact null with
      equal true slopes the folded statistic makes the normal-theory Z anti-conservative (over-rejects;
      measured ~0.14 at nominal .05 in the crate's Monte-Carlo) -- prefer the signed test when uniform
      DIF is the alternative.

    ``se`` is the delta-method standard error using each group's ``se_a``, ``se_b``, and ``cov_ab``
    (the a-b sampling covariance from that group's calibration; pass zeros if unavailable, at the cost
    of a misstated variance). Each group's covariance must satisfy the positive-semi-definite bound
    ``|cov_ab| <= se_a * se_b`` or the call is rejected. ``z = H / se(H)`` from unscaled quantities; with a common per-item
    pseudo-guessing ``guess`` (3PL), ``h`` and ``se`` are reported scaled by ``(1 - c)`` while ``z``
    is unchanged (the convention of the difR reference implementation). ``dif_items`` flags
    ``|z| > z_{1-alpha/2}``.

    **Provenance.** The primary papers (Raju, 1988, 1990) were NOT read (paywalled). The formula
    oracle is the difR package source (``RajuZ.R``, ``difRaju.R``; Magis et al., 2010 -- code READ in
    full, package paper not read). Both areas and all four delta-method partials were additionally
    re-derived by hand and verified against numeric quadrature and finite differences during
    adversarial spec review; difR's gradient is the uniform negation of the derivative of ``H``
    (variance-equivalent), and its ``exp(Y)`` overflow branch carries a sign this implementation's
    softplus formulation never needs.

    """Zumbo (1999) logistic-regression DIF for dichotomous items (compute in Rust; Swaminathan &
    Rogers, 1990).

    Each item response is regressed on the observed matching score ``S`` (number-correct total, studied
    item included by default), the group ``G``, and their interaction, in three NESTED logistic models:
    ``M0: b0 + b1 S``; ``M1: + b2 G``; ``M2: + b3 (S x G)``. This separates UNIFORM from NON-UNIFORM
    (crossing) DIF — the latter is invisible to :func:`mantel_haenszel_dif`, whose stratified odds-ratio
    test can only detect a consistent group advantage.

    - ``chi2_total`` / ``p_total`` (2 df) is the PRIMARY Swaminathan-Rogers/Zumbo omnibus DIF test and is
      the value Benjamini-Hochberg adjusts (``flagged_bh``).
    - ``chi2_nonuniform`` / ``p_nonuniform`` (1 df) tests the interaction ``b3``.
    - ``chi2_uniform`` / ``p_uniform`` (1 df) tests ``b2`` *assuming* ``b3 = 0``; it is a descriptive
      follow-up, is NOT the group term of the full model, and is not interpretable when non-uniform DIF
      is present. Component p-values are unadjusted.
    - ``delta_r2`` is the Nagelkerke pseudo-R² change ``R2(M2) - R2(M0)`` (Zumbo's effect size), and
      ``jg_class`` classifies it by Jodoin & Gierl (2001): ``"A"`` negligible (< 0.035), ``"B"`` moderate,
      ``"C"`` large (>= 0.070) — forced to ``"A"`` when the omnibus test is not BH-significant, and
      ``"U"`` when undefined. ``delta_r2_uniform`` is an uncalibrated descriptive value with no class.
      (The older Zumbo & Thomas, 1997 cut-offs of 0.13/0.26 are much more conservative.)

    Items whose fits fail (separation, a rank-deficient design, no convergence) report ``NaN``
    statistics with ``converged=False`` and are never flagged. As with Mantel-Haenszel, the studied item
    is included in the matching score and this function does not purify it (see
    :func:`logistic_dif_purified`); logistic-regression DIF
    additionally assumes the logit is linear in ``S``, so a non-uniform flag is not by itself proof of
    crossing item characteristic curves.

    ``responses`` is a persons x items ``0/1`` array (no missing data); ``group`` is length-persons with
    ``0`` = reference and ``1`` = focal. Returns per-item NumPy arrays keyed as above.

    """Breslow-Day (1980, Eq. 4.30) odds-ratio homogeneity DIF test (compute in Rust).

    The classical NON-UNIFORM DIF companion to :func:`mantel_haenszel_dif`: MH tests whether a
    common odds ratio differs from 1; this tests whether a COMMON odds ratio is tenable at all
    across the matching-score strata. Per stratum, the fitted reference-correct count ``A_k`` is
    the admissible root of the quadratic ``A D / (B C) = psi_hat`` with the observed margins, the
    asymptotic variance is ``1 / (1/A + 1/B + 1/C + 1/D)`` on the fitted cells, and ``chi2`` is
    ``sum (a_k - A_k)^2 / Var_k`` referred to ``chi2(K - 1)`` over the ``K`` used strata (all four
    margins positive). The plugged-in ``psi_hat`` is the crate's Mantel-Haenszel ``alpha_mh``,
    the estimator the read source itself endorses for this test (its worked example: MH 5.158 ->
    chi2 9.28 vs MLE 5.312 -> 9.33, same conclusion). The Tarone (1985) correction is NOT applied
    (that source was not read -- out of scope, documented in the core header).

    ``responses`` is a persons x items array of 0/1 scores (no missing data). ``group`` is a
    length-persons array with ``0`` = reference and ``1`` = focal (both must be present).
    Returns per-item arrays ``alpha_mh``, ``chi2``, ``df``, ``p_value``, ``n_strata_used``,
    ``flagged_bh``. NaN statistics mark items with a degenerate MH odds ratio (``sum a d = 0``
    or ``sum b c = 0``), fewer than two usable strata, or an inadmissible fitted root.
