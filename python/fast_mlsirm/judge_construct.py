"""Validated construct-level measurement contract for LLM-as-a-Judge handoffs.

Automated judges and downstream agents frequently mis-specify the measurement
side of an IRT handoff: they submit a single scalar score where a multi-item
construct is required, treat one-based rating labels as zero-based categories,
or ship rubrics too short to identify a unidimensional factor. This module
owns the package-level contract for that boundary so every caller receives
the same validated answer before any model fitting starts.

Contract summary
----------------

1. One judge criterion is one polytomous or dichotomous item. A scalar judge
   result is not an IRT observation.
2. Categories are always zero based: valid categories are ``0 .. k - 1`` for
   ``k`` ordered options, matching the internal representation used by every
   fast-mlsirm estimator (the recursive Lord-Wingersky style formulas index
   categories from zero even when a rubric displays ``1, 2, 3, ...``).
3. A unidimensional judge construct (one facet) must carry at least
   :data:`MIN_JUDGE_CONSTRUCT_ITEMS` criteria by default, with
   :data:`RECOMMENDED_JUDGE_CONSTRUCT_ITEMS` as the recommended target and at
   most :data:`MAX_JUDGE_CONSTRUCT_ITEMS` before the rubric should be split
   into separate facets.

The item-count policy is deliberately stricter than the bare identification
floor. Factor models are only identified from three salient variables per
common factor (Thurstone, 1947; Fabrigar et al., 1999), applied measurement
guidance asks for three indicators minimum with five or more preferred
(Hair et al., 2019), and facet scales in validated inventories commonly carry
about eight items per facet (Costa & McCrae, 1992). The default floor of five
items keeps judge-derived constructs inside that evidence-backed range while
:data:`ABSOLUTE_JUDGE_CONSTRUCT_FLOOR` preserves the hard mathematical
boundary for explicitly acknowledged short forms.
