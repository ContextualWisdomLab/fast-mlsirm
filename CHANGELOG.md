# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Changed

- Vectorized the MMLE-EM M-step Newton-Raphson updates across items with an
  active-convergence mask in `python/fast_mlsirm/estimators/mmle.py`, replacing
  the per-item Python loop with batched BLAS-backed matrix operations while
  preserving the per-item convergence and singular-Hessian break semantics.

- Exposed the Rust MMLE-EM estimator (`mlsirm_core::mmle::fit_mmle_2pl`) through
  the PyO3 binding as `fast_mlsirm._core.fit_mmle_2pl`, so
  `fit(estimator="mmle")` now runs on the Rust core when the extension is built
  (previously it always fell back to the NumPy reference). To keep the two
  backends statistically equivalent, the Rust core's Gauss-Hermite table was
  aligned from 21 to 41 nodes, bit-identical to the NumPy reference's default
  `hermegauss(41)` quadrature; `tests/test_rust_parity.py` gains MMLE parity
  tests (a/b/theta agreement at the shared EM optimum, measured ~1e-8).

- Made the Rust core (`fast_mlsirm._core`) the **primary** numeric path: the
  default `FitConfig.backend` and CLI `--backend` are now `"auto"`, resolving to
  Rust when the compiled extension is available and falling back to the NumPy
  reference otherwise. The verified LSIRM/MLS2PLM neg-loglik, gradient, and
  distance-kernel formulas are ported bit-for-bit; observable outputs are
  unchanged.

### Added

- GPGPU acceleration of the negative-log-likelihood and gradient hot path inside
  the Rust core via [wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu) (MIT/Apache-2.0),
  exposed as a device sub-option of the Rust backend rather than a separate
  compute-backend axis. Select with `FitConfig(backend="rust", rust_device=...)`
  or `fast-mlsirm fit --backend rust --rust-device {auto,cpu,gpu}`; the GPU path
  falls back to the identical CPU implementation at runtime when no GPU adapter
  is available. Added requested-device provenance on `FitResult.rust_device`
  and in `fit_summary.json`, plus numerical-parity tests asserting the Rust
  device paths match the NumPy reference.
- Added `docs/papers/README.md` with a citation and canonical link for Wu et al.
  (2021, arXiv:2108.11579), grounding fast, accelerator-friendly IRT estimation
  without vendoring the PDF into the repository.
- Added `tests/test_rust_parity.py`, a Rust<->NumPy numerical parity gate that
  asserts agreement to `1e-6` across all five model variants, multiple problem
  sizes, and masked/dense fixtures (observed difference ~1e-13).
- Added a Rust toolchain plus a resolved-default-backend assertion to the
  `python` CI job so the primary Rust path is built and exercised by the suite.
- Added `scripts/release_acceptance.py` to execute a sales-readiness end-to-end
  smoke: simulate, fit (auto + optional rust), diagnostics, and report rendering.
- Added `docs/release_acceptance.md` to document acceptance inputs, outputs, and
  pass criteria.
- Added `docs/enterprise_sales_readiness.md` and `scripts/sales_readiness.py`
  to produce a machine-readable enterprise procurement readiness manifest.
- Added aFIPC-style fixed-item calibration diagnostics and
  `diagnose-fixed-item-calibration` to select candidate probability tensors
  with kaefa-style item-fit penalty evidence.

### CI

- Replaced package-only Rust smoke with release-acceptance execution in CI.
- Added an enterprise sales-readiness gate to validate acceptance evidence,
  policy documents, package artifacts, installed-version consistency, and Rust
  backend import proof.

### Documentation

- Updated commercial-readiness and README documents to point to the acceptance
  checklist and execution command.
- Added KRW 2,000,000,000 enterprise sales-review criteria and explicit go/no-go
  evidence requirements.
- Updated the Figma product design packet with Information Architecture,
  화면정의서, key screen, wireframe, and user stories for fixed-item
  calibration review.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-07-02

### Added

- MLS2PLM simulation, fitting, diagnostics, and HTML report generation.
- Optional Rust/PyO3 backend exposed as `fast_mlsirm._core`.
- Backend selection through `FitConfig.backend` and `fast-mlsirm fit --backend`.
- Fit summary persistence of the resolved backend.
- Commercial beta readiness documentation, support policy, security policy, and
  release verification checklist.

### Known Limits

- Current estimators are regularized point-estimate JML/MAP-style workflows,
  not Bayesian posterior samplers.
- Ordinal response estimators, sparse/block execution, benchmark automation,
  and posterior predictive checks remain future work.
