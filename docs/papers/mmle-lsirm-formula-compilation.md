| `β_i` | item main effect ("easiness"; note sign convention `+β_i`) |
| `z_p ∈ ℝ^D` (paper: `a_j`) | latent position of respondent `p` |
| `w_i ∈ ℝ^D` (paper: `b_i`) | latent position of item `i` |

## 1. Base LSIRM (Jeon, Jin, Schweinberger & Baugh, 2021) `[V]`

### 1.1 Model

General interaction form (paper Eq. 2), with `g(·,·)` a real-valued function of the two positions:
$$
\operatorname{logit}\!\big(P(Y_{pi}=1\mid \theta_p,\beta_i,z_p,w_i)\big)=\theta_p+\beta_i+g(z_p,w_i).
$$

Two choices of `g`:

- **Distance effect (the LSIRM proper, recommended by the authors):**
$$
g(z_p,w_i)=-\gamma\, d(z_p,w_i),\qquad \gamma\ge 0,
$$
giving the working model
$$
\boxed{\;\operatorname{logit}\!\big(P(Y_{pi}=1)\big)=\theta_p+\beta_i-\gamma\,\lVert z_p-w_i\rVert\;}
\tag{LSIRM}
$$
`γ>0` makes the success probability **decrease** in the respondent–item distance. Distance choices
discussed: `ℓ₁` (city-block), `ℓ₂` (Euclidean, default), `ℓ∞` (maximum).

- **Multiplicative (bilinear) effect:** `g(z_p,w_i)=z_p^⊤ w_i` (inner product). Related to Hoff's (2005)
bilinear mixed-effects / additive-and-multiplicative-effects network models. Harder to interpret (the
effect is 0 whenever the vectors are orthogonal, regardless of distance), so the paper focuses on the
distance form.

**Relation to other models** (paper §2.3.2): the 2-parameter IRT model
`logit P = λ_i θ_p + β_i` and the saturated interaction model `logit P = θ_p + β_i + ε_{pi}` are alternatives;
the LSIRM is the special case `ε_{pi} = −γ d(z_p,w_i)`. The distance restriction (reflexivity, symmetry,
triangle inequality) is what makes the interaction **estimable** from a single response per (p,i) pair
and injects transitivity (nearby respondents behave similarly).

### 1.2 Priors (fully Bayesian original) `[V]`

$$
\begin{aligned}
\theta_p\mid\sigma^2 &\overset{ind}{\sim} N(0,\sigma^2), & \sigma^2>0,\\
\beta_i\mid\tau_\beta^2 &\overset{ind}{\sim} N(0,\tau_\beta^2), & \tau_\beta^2>0,\\
\log\gamma\mid\mu_\gamma,\tau_\gamma^2 &\sim N(\mu_\gamma,\tau_\gamma^2), & \mu_\gamma\in\mathbb R,\ \tau_\gamma^2>0,\\
\sigma^2\mid a_\sigma,b_\sigma &\sim \text{Inv-Gamma}(a_\sigma,b_\sigma), & a_\sigma,b_\sigma>0,\\
z_p &\overset{iid}{\sim}\mathrm{MVN}_D(\mathbf 0, I_D), & p=1,\dots,N,\\
w_i &\overset{iid}{\sim}\mathrm{MVN}_D(\mathbf 0, I_D), & i=1,\dots,I.
\end{aligned}
$$
Default hyperparameters used in the paper: `τ_β²=4, a_σ=1, b_σ=1, μ_γ=0.5, τ_γ²=1`.
A prior is placed on **positions** (not distances) because distances must satisfy the triangle inequality,
which is awkward to encode directly.

Joint posterior (paper Eq. 5):
$$
f(\theta,\beta,\gamma,Z,W\mid y)\propto
\Big[\textstyle\prod_p f(\theta_p)\Big]\Big[\prod_i f(\beta_i)\Big]f(\gamma)
\Big[\prod_p f(z_p)\Big]\Big[\prod_i f(w_i)\Big]
\prod_{p}\prod_{i}P(Y_{pi}=y_{pi}\mid\theta_p,\beta_i,\gamma,z_p,w_i).
$$

### 1.3 Estimation in the original: MCMC (Metropolis-within-Gibbs) `[V]`

Component-wise updates per iteration `t`; each block accepted with the usual MH ratio
`min{1, f(·*|rest)/f(·^{(t)}|rest)}` using symmetric (multivariate) Gaussian random-walk proposals
centered at the current value with diagonal covariance, tuned to an acceptance rate ≈ 0.3:

1. `θ_p*` (all `p`); 2. `β_i*` (all `i`); 3. `γ*`; 4. `z_p*` (all `p`); 5. `w_i*` (all `i`);
6. Gibbs draw of `σ²` from its full conditional:
$$
\sigma^2\sim \text{Inv-Gamma}\!\left(a_\sigma+\tfrac{N}{2},\; b_\sigma+\tfrac{1}{2}\textstyle\sum_{p=1}^N\theta_p^2\right).
$$
Convergence via trace plots + Gelman–Rubin `R̂`.

### 1.4 Identifiability of the latent space `[V]`

The log-odds depends on positions only through **distances**, which are invariant to **translation,
rotation, and reflection** of the whole configuration; hence the likelihood is invariant under these
transformations (the same non-identifiability as in latent space network models, Hoff, Raftery &
Handcock, 2002). Resolution: **post-process the MCMC/optimization output with Procrustes matching**
(Gower, 1975) to a reference configuration; interpret only **relative** distances. Additional practical
pins: the `MVN_D(0, I_D)` prior centers the map at the origin (removes translation); for a point estimate,
also fix scale. The multiplicative/inner-product variant has **only rotational** invariance
(`z^⊤w = (Rz)^⊤(Rw)` for orthogonal `R`).

> **Implementation note.** For an MMLE/point-estimate pipeline, resolve invariance by: (i) mean-centering
> `Z` and `W` each iteration (translation); (ii) Procrustes-rotating the current `W` to a fixed reference
> `W₀` (rotation+reflection); (iii) fixing `γ>0` scale or standardizing position variance. Anchoring a few
> items' positions is an alternative that also enables cross-group comparability (see §6).

### 1.5 Model selection (`γ=0` Rasch vs. `γ>0` LSIRM)

Compare the Rasch/1PL nested model (`γ=0`) against LSIRM. The original uses Bayesian comparison; the R
package uses **BIC** and maximum log-posterior (§2.4). A spike-and-slab mixture prior on `γ` (mass near 0
vs. spread over positives) yields a built-in test of whether an interaction map is needed.

---

## 2. LSIRM variants (Go, Kim, Park, Park, Jeon & Jin — `lsirm12pl`) `[V]`

### 2.1 1PL LSIRM (binary) — as §1, package Eq. (2)
$$
\operatorname{logit}\!\big(P(Y_{pi}=1\mid\theta_p,\beta_i,\gamma,z_p,w_i)\big)=\theta_p+\beta_i-\gamma\,\lVert z_p-w_i\rVert,\qquad \theta_p\sim N(0,\sigma^2).
$$

### 2.2 2PL LSIRM (binary)
$$
\operatorname{logit}\!\big(P(Y_{pi}=1)\big)=\alpha_i\,\theta_p+\beta_i-\gamma\,\lVert z_p-w_i\rVert,\qquad \theta_p\sim N(0,\sigma^2).
$$
`α_i` = item discrimination. **Identification of slopes:** fix one slope, `α_1=1`.
**Prior:** `log α_i ∼ N(μ_α, τ_α²)` (log-normal, keeps `α_i>0`); package defaults `μ_α=0.5, τ_α=1`.
All other priors as in §1.2.

### 2.3 Continuous (Gaussian) LSIRM — identity link
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{1PL:}\quad Y_{pi}&=\theta_p+\beta_i-\gamma\,\lVert z_p-w_i\rVert+\epsilon_{pi},\\
\text{2PL:}\quad Y_{pi}&=\alpha_i\theta_p+\beta_i-\gamma\,\lVert z_p-w_i\rVert+\epsilon_{pi},
\end{aligned}
\qquad \epsilon_{pi}\sim N(0,\sigma_\epsilon^2),\ \theta_p\sim N(0,\sigma^2).
$$
Likelihood is a product of normals `∏_p ∏_i N(Y_{pi};\,\mu_{pi},\sigma_\epsilon^2)` with mean `μ_{pi}` the
linear predictor. Extra prior: `σ_ε² ∼ Inv-Gamma(a_{σε}, b_{σε})`. Two distinct variance components:
`σ²` = prior variance of `θ_p`; `σ_ε²` = residual variance.

### 2.4 Estimation & fit in the package
Fully Bayesian **Metropolis-Hastings-within-Gibbs** (Chib & Greenberg, 1995) for all of
`θ,β,γ,Z,W` (plus `α`, `σ_ε²`). MAR missingness handled by data augmentation (Tanner & Wong, 1987).
Identifiability by **Procrustes** post-processing (Gower, 1975). Reported diagnostics: **BIC**, max
log-posterior, posterior-predictive item-mean plots + ROC/AUC (binary), trace/ACF/Gelman–Rubin–Brooks.
No MML/EM/variational in the package — motivating §3–§4 below.

---

## 3. MMLE / EM formulation (the frequentist estimation target)

LSIRM has latent quantities **per person** (`θ_p`, `z_p ∈ ℝ^D`) and **per item** (`w_i ∈ ℝ^D`), plus
structural parameters `ξ = (β, γ, σ², [α], [σ_ε²])`. Two coherent frequentist framings:

### 3.A Random-effects / marginal likelihood (persons integrated out) `[S]`

Treat person latents `(θ_p, z_p)` as random effects with densities `θ_p∼N(0,σ²)`, `z_p∼MVN_D(0,I_D)`;
treat item positions `w_i`, `β_i`, `γ` as **structural parameters** to estimate. The marginal likelihood is
$$
L(\xi, W;\,y)=\prod_{p=1}^{N}\ \int_{\mathbb R}\!\int_{\mathbb R^{D}}
\ \prod_{i=1}^{I} P_{pi}^{\,y_{pi}}\,(1-P_{pi})^{\,1-y_{pi}}\ \phi(\theta_p;\sigma^2)\,\phi_D(z_p)\ dz_p\,d\theta_p,
$$
with `P_{pi}=\operatorname{logit}^{-1}(\theta_p+\beta_i-\gamma\lVert z_p-w_i\rVert)`. This is the LSIRM analogue
of Bock & Aitkin (1981). The item positions `w_i` are *not* integrated out here — they are the map we want.
(One may symmetrically put `w_i` as random effects and integrate them out too; then `Z` is estimated, or
one alternates — see §3.C MH-RM, which handles both cleanly.)

#### 3.A.1 Bock–Aitkin EM for the trait margin (classical IRT baseline) `[~]`
For the **ability-only** margin (fixing `γ`, `Z` momentarily, or for a plain 2PL calibration), the classic
EM with Gauss–Hermite quadrature applies. Approximate `∫ h(θ)g(θ)dθ ≈ Σ_{q=1}^{Q} h(X_q)A_q` at nodes
`X_q` with weights `A_q`.

**E-step.** Posterior weight of node `q` for person `p`:
$$
P(X_q\mid y_p)=\frac{L_p(X_q)\,A_q}{\sum_{q'=1}^{Q}L_p(X_{q'})\,A_{q'}},\qquad
L_p(X_q)=\prod_i P_i(X_q)^{y_{pi}}\big(1-P_i(X_q)\big)^{1-y_{pi}}.
$$
Expected counts (artificial data):
$$
\bar N_q=\sum_{p=1}^{N}P(X_q\mid y_p),\qquad
\bar r_{iq}=\sum_{p=1}^{N}y_{pi}\,P(X_q\mid y_p).
$$

**M-step.** For each item `i`, maximize the expected complete-data log-likelihood
$$
\sum_{q=1}^{Q}\Big[\bar r_{iq}\log P_i(X_q)+(\bar N_q-\bar r_{iq})\log\big(1-P_i(X_q)\big)\Big]
$$
i.e. a weighted binomial fit. For the 2PL `P_i(θ)=\operatorname{logit}^{-1}(α_i θ+β_i)` the likelihood
equations are
$$
\sum_{q}\big(\bar r_{iq}-\bar N_q P_i(X_q)\big)=0,\qquad
\sum_{q}\big(\bar r_{iq}-\bar N_q P_i(X_q)\big)X_q=0,
$$
solved by Newton–Raphson / Fisher scoring. Iterate E/M to convergence. The population `σ²` (or a free mean)
is updated from the moments of the posterior `P(X_q|y_p)`.

#### 3.A.2 Why plain quadrature fails for the full LSIRM, and what to do `[S]`
The per-person latent is `(1+D)`-dimensional; a `Q`-point grid needs `Q^{1+D}` nodes (curse of
dimensionality), infeasible for `D≥2`. Practical E-steps:

- **Monte-Carlo / importance-sampling E-step (MCEM):** draw `m` samples `(θ_p^{(s)}, z_p^{(s)})` from (an
  approximation to) the posterior `f(θ_p,z_p\mid y_p,\xi,W)` and replace the integral by the sample average.
  Expected complete-data log-likelihood gradient wrt structural params:
  `∇_ξ Q ≈ (1/m) Σ_s ∇_ξ log f(y_p,θ_p^{(s)},z_p^{(s)};ξ,W)`.
- **Adaptive Gauss–Hermite** (Laplace-centered nodes per person) — viable for small `D`.
- **Stochastic EM / MH-RM (§3.C)** — the recommended route for LSIRM.

### 3.B Joint maximum likelihood (JML) — Hoff–Raftery–Handcock lineage `[~]`

Treat **all** `θ_p, z_p, w_i, β_i, γ` as fixed parameters and maximize the joint log-likelihood
$$
\ell(\Xi)=\sum_{p=1}^{N}\sum_{i=1}^{I}\Big[y_{pi}\log P_{pi}+(1-y_{pi})\log(1-P_{pi})\Big],
$$
by block coordinate ascent (gradient steps alternating persons ↔ items). Hoff, Raftery & Handcock (2002)
introduced this exact idea for **latent space network models**: obtain MLE latent positions (they used
distances from a logistic regression + MDS start), then refine — and it transfers directly to LSIRM's
distance model. Gradients (Euclidean distance `d_{pi}=\lVert z_p-w_i\rVert`, unit vector
`u_{pi}=(z_p-w_i)/d_{pi}`):
$$
\frac{\partial\ell}{\partial\theta_p}=\sum_i (y_{pi}-P_{pi}),\quad
\frac{\partial\ell}{\partial\beta_i}=\sum_p (y_{pi}-P_{pi}),\quad
\frac{\partial\ell}{\partial\gamma}=-\sum_{p,i}(y_{pi}-P_{pi})\,d_{pi},
$$
$$
\frac{\partial\ell}{\partial z_p}=-\gamma\sum_i (y_{pi}-P_{pi})\,u_{pi},\qquad
\frac{\partial\ell}{\partial w_i}=+\gamma\sum_p (y_{pi}-P_{pi})\,u_{pi}.
$$
**Caveats:** JML latent positions are unidentified up to translation/rotation/reflection (re-Procrustes
each iteration; center `Z,W`); and JML suffers the **incidental-parameters (Neyman–Scott) problem** — with
person and item latents both growing, estimates of structural parameters can be inconsistent. Use JML for
a fast warm start, then hand off to the marginal estimator (§3.A/§3.C) for consistent structural estimates.
A ridge/prior penalty (equivalently the `MVN_D(0,I_D)` prior as an `ℓ₂` penalty on positions) regularizes
the otherwise flat directions.

### 3.C MH-RM (Cai, 2010) — recommended MML estimator for LSIRM `[V for algorithm, ~ for LSIRM specialization]`

Metropolis–Hastings Robbins–Monro is stochastic-approximation EM built for exactly this regime (many
latents, high dimension). Let complete data be `(y, φ)` with latent `φ=({θ_p,z_p}_p, [ {w_i}_i ])` and
structural `ξ`. Uses **Fisher's identity** `∇_ξ log L(ξ) = E_φ[ ∇_ξ log f(y,φ;ξ) \mid y,ξ ]`.

Iteration `t`:
1. **Imputation (MH):** draw `φ^{(t)}` with a few Metropolis–Hastings steps from `f(φ\mid y,\xi^{(t-1)})`
   (random-walk proposals on `θ_p, z_p, w_i`).
2. **Approximation:** form the complete-data score (ascent direction) and (optionally) an information
   estimate at the imputed data,
   $$
   s^{(t)}=\nabla_\xi \log f\big(y,\varphi^{(t)};\xi^{(t-1)}\big),\qquad
   H^{(t)}=\text{recursive estimate of }-\nabla^2\ \text{(or empirical info)}.
   $$
3. **Robbins–Monro update:**
   $$
   \xi^{(t)}=\xi^{(t-1)}+\varepsilon_t\,\big(H^{(t)}\big)^{-1}s^{(t)},\qquad
   \sum_t \varepsilon_t=\infty,\ \ \sum_t \varepsilon_t^2<\infty\ (\text{e.g. }\varepsilon_t=1/t).
   $$
The estimate sequence converges w.p.1 to the MML solution. Standard errors come from the recursive
information accumulation (Louis's identity). Because MH-RM only needs to *sample* `φ` (never integrate),
it sidesteps the `Q^{1+D}` quadrature blow-up — the practical reason to prefer it for LSIRM. (Reference
implementation for multidimensional IRT: `mirt::mirt(..., method = "MHRM")`.)

### 3.D Variational / importance-sampling MML `[~]`

Mean-field or Gaussian variational inference maximizes the ELBO
$$
\log p(y)\ \ge\ \mathcal L(q)=\mathbb E_{q}\big[\log p(y,\varphi,\xi)\big]-\mathbb E_q[\log q(\varphi)],
$$
with `q(φ)=∏_p N(θ_p;m_p,s_p^2)\,N_D(z_p;μ_p,Σ_p)\,∏_i N_D(w_i;ν_i,Ω_i)`. For the latent-space *network*
model, Gaussian VI (Salter-Townshend & Murphy, 2013) gives fast, scalable position estimates and transfers
to LSIRM's distance likelihood via a local (delta / quadratic) bound on `log σ(·)` or a Pólya–Gamma
augmentation for the logistic term. Variational IRT (Wu et al., 2020; Natesan-style SVI) demonstrates the
same idea for the trait margin. Treat VI as a fast approximate MML; expect variances to be under-estimated.

---

## 4. Multilevel (hierarchical) extension

### 4.1 HLSIRM (Park, Shin, Jeon, Kim & Jin, 2026) `[V]`

Students `i` nested in schools `k`, items `j`. **Inner-product** interaction with a stochastic error
(no `γ`; follows Hoff's additive-and-multiplicative-effects models):
$$
\operatorname{logit}\!\big(P(y_{ij(k)}=1)\big)=\alpha_{i(k)}+\beta_j+z_{i(k)}^{\top}w_j+\varepsilon_{ij(k)},
\qquad \varepsilon_{ij(k)}\overset{iid}{\sim}N(0,1). \tag{HLSIRM}
$$
Matrix form for school `k` (`Θ^{(k)}` the `n_k×p` logit matrix):
`logit(Θ^{(k)}) = α_{(k)} 1_p^⊤ + 1_{n_k} β^⊤ + Z^{(k)} W^⊤ + E^{(k)}`.

**Multilevel structure (random effects at the school level):**
$$
\alpha_{i(k)}\mid\alpha_{(k)},\sigma^2_{(k)}\sim N(\alpha_{(k)},\sigma^2_{(k)}),\qquad
z_{i(k)}\mid z_{(k)},\Psi_z\sim \mathrm{MVN}(z_{(k)},\Psi_z),
$$
i.e. the decomposition `θ_{pg}=μ_g+ε_{pg}` is realized here as a student intercept scattered around its
**school-level mean** `α_{(k)}`, and a student position scattered around its **school-level position**
`z_{(k)}`. `σ²_{(k)}` is a **school-specific within-school variance component**; `Ψ_z` a shared
within-school position covariance.

**Key design choice — one shared map.** Item parameters `β_j, w_j` are **common across schools**
(no hierarchy on items) → measurement invariance → schools are directly comparable inside a **single unified
interaction map**; each school has its own `(α_{(k)}, z_{(k)})` within it. (This differs from fitting
separate per-group models and stitching them together.)

**Priors / hyperpriors:**
$$
\begin{aligned}
\alpha_{(k)}\mid\sigma_\alpha^2&\sim N(\alpha_0,\sigma_\alpha^2), &
z_{(k)}\mid\Psi_z&\sim \mathrm{MVN}(z_0,\Psi_z/\kappa_0),\\
\sigma^2_{(k)}&\sim \text{Inv-Gamma}(a_\sigma,b_\sigma), &
\Psi_z&\sim \text{Inv-Wishart}(S_z,\nu_z),\\
\beta_j&\sim N(\beta_0,\tau^2), &
w_j\mid\Psi_w&\sim \mathrm{MVN}(w_0,\Psi_w),\quad \Psi_w\sim \text{Inv-Wishart}(S_w,\nu_w).
\end{aligned}
$$
Values used: `α_0=β_0=0`, `z_0=w_0=0`, `σ_α=τ=2.5` (fixed for identifiability), `ν_z=ν_w=D+1`,
`S_z=S_w=2·I`, `κ_0=1`, `a_σ=b_σ=1`, error precision fixed (`1/φ=1`, confounded with parameter scale).
**Interaction-adjusted summaries** (Kang & Jeon, 2024):
`α̃_{(k)}=α_{(k)}+\tfrac1p Σ_j z_{(k)}^⊤ w_j`, `β̃_j=β_j+\tfrac1K Σ_k z_{(k)}^⊤ w_j`.

**Estimation:** fully Bayesian MCMC; a **joint per-school** Metropolis–Hastings acceptance for the coupled
block `(α_{(k)}, α_{i(k)}, β_j, z_{(k)}, z_{i(k)}, w_j)`, with conjugate Gibbs draws for the Inv-Gamma /
Inv-Wishart variance/covariance components. **Identifiability:** inner-product form has only rotational
invariance; resolved by **Procrustes** alignment of *all* positions to a reference; cross-school
comparability comes from the shared item parameters (no per-school anchoring needed). **Checking:**
posterior-predictive replication + classification metrics (AUC, F1).

> **MMLE version of the multilevel model.** To estimate HLSIRM (or a distance-based multilevel LSIRM) by
> marginal likelihood, integrate out **both** student-level latents `(α_{i(k)}, z_{i(k)})` *and* the
> school-level latents `(α_{(k)}, z_{(k)})`, keeping `β_j, w_j` (and variance components
> `σ²_{(k)}, Ψ_z, σ_α², τ²`) as structural parameters. The nested integral factorizes over schools, so an
> MH-RM E-step samples student latents given school latents, then school latents given the rest — a natural
> two-level Gibbs imputation inside the Robbins–Monro update (§3.C). Variance components update from the
> usual random-effects EM moment equations, e.g. `σ_α² ← (1/K)Σ_k E[(α_{(k)}-α_0)²\mid y]`.

### 4.2 Generic multilevel IRT (Fox & Glas, 2001; Fox, 2010) `[S]`

A two-level model with a **measurement** level and a **structural** level. Level-1 (e.g. normal-ogive /
2PL): `P(Y_{pjk}=1)=Φ(a_i θ_{pj}-b_i)` for person `p` in group `j`. Level-2 (person abilities as outcomes):
$$
\theta_{pj}=x_{pj}^\top\beta + u_{0j}+e_{pj},\qquad u_{0j}\sim N(0,\tau^2),\ e_{pj}\sim N(0,\sigma^2),
$$
so a random-intercept model gives `θ_{pj}=γ_{00}+u_{0j}+e_{pj}`, `Var(θ)=τ^2+σ^2`, with intraclass
correlation `ρ=τ^2/(τ^2+σ^2)`. Estimated by Gibbs sampling (Fox & Glas) or MML with a nested random-effects
integral. This is the template the multilevel LSIRM specializes by adding the latent-position layer.

---

## 5. Multigroup extension

### 5.1 Bock & Zimowski (1997) multiple-group IRT `[S]`

Groups `g=1,…,G`; person `p` in group `g` has trait `θ_{pg}`. Item parameters are **common** (anchored)
across groups; group populations differ in mean/variance:
$$
P(Y_{pi}=1\mid\theta_{pg})=c_i+(1-c_i)\,\operatorname{logit}^{-1}\!\big(a_i(\theta_{pg}-b_i)\big),
\qquad \theta_{pg}\sim N(\mu_g,\sigma_g^2).
$$
**Identification:** fix one reference group `μ_1=0, σ_1^2=1` (or impose `Σ_g μ_g=0`); estimate `(μ_g,σ_g^2)`
for the others. Marginal likelihood sums the Bock–Aitkin margin (§3.A.1) group-by-group with
group-specific quadrature weights `A_{q}^{(g)}` from `N(μ_g,σ_g^2)`:
$$
L=\prod_{g}\prod_{p\in g}\ \sum_{q} A_q^{(g)}\prod_i P_i(X_q)^{y_{pi}}(1-P_i(X_q))^{1-y_{pi}}.
$$
**DIF framing / measurement invariance:** designate **anchor** items with group-invariant parameters;
allow **studied** items' `(a_i,b_i)` to differ across groups. A likelihood-ratio / Wald test on the
group-specific vs. common item parameters is the DIF test; full invariance ⇒ all items anchored.

### 5.2 Multigroup LSIRM (construction) `[~]`

No dedicated multigroup-LSIRM paper was located online; the natural specification mirrors §5.1 and the
HLSIRM invariance logic:

- **Shared map + group trait distributions:** common `β_i, w_i, γ`; group traits `θ_{pg}∼N(μ_g,σ_g²)`
  and group positions `z_{pg}∼MVN_D(m_g,Σ_g)` with a fixed reference group `μ_1=0,σ_1^2=1,m_1=0,Σ_1=I_D`.
  Enables comparing group **latent-space centroids** on one map (this is exactly what HLSIRM does with
  schools as the grouping).
- **Group-specific item positions (interaction DIF):** let `w_i^{(g)}` differ across groups for studied
  items while anchor items keep a common `w_i`; a large `γ`-weighted shift `\lVert w_i^{(g)}-w_i^{(g')}\rVert`
  flags an item whose respondent–item interaction is group-dependent — the LSIRM analogue of DIF.

**Cross-group identifiability:** the invariance (translation/rotation/reflection) must be resolved
**jointly** across groups. Either (i) anchor ≥ `D+1` common items to a fixed reference configuration and
Procrustes-map every group to it, or (ii) estimate all groups in one shared space with common item
parameters (HLSIRM route). Anchoring is what makes group centroids comparable.

## 6. Multidimensional extension (MIRT) and its relation to LSIRM

### 6.1 Compensatory MIRT (Reckase, 2009) `[S]`

For a `d`-dimensional trait `θ_p∈ℝ^d`, item slope vector `a_i∈ℝ^d`, intercept `d_i`:
$$
P(Y_{pi}=1\mid\theta_p)=c_i+(1-c_i)\,\operatorname{logit}^{-1}\!\big(a_i^\top\theta_p+d_i\big).
$$
Summary indices:
$$
\text{MDISC}_i=\lVert a_i\rVert=\sqrt{\textstyle\sum_{m=1}^d a_{im}^2},\qquad
\text{MDIFF}_i=\frac{-d_i}{\lVert a_i\rVert},\qquad
\text{direction cosines }=\frac{a_{im}}{\text{MDISC}_i}.
$$
"Compensatory" because a low coordinate of `θ_p` can be offset by a high one through the inner product.
Estimated by MML/EM or MH-RM; identifiability fixed by rotation constraints (as in factor analysis).

### 6.2 How LSIRM relates `[~]`

- The **multiplicative** LSIRM term `z_p^⊤ w_i` is algebraically a MIRT compensatory term with item
  "loadings" `= w_i` and person "traits" `= z_p` (a bilinear/eigenmodel factorization, as HLSIRM uses).
  So a `D`-dimensional inner-product LSIRM ≈ a `D`-dimensional compensatory MIRT with the main effects
  `θ_p,β_i` as an extra rank-one term.
- The **distance** LSIRM term `−γ\lVert z_p-w_i\rVert` is **non-compensatory / ideal-point-like**: the
  probability is maximized when the respondent sits *at* the item's location and falls off symmetrically in
  every direction — closer to an unfolding model than to a monotone MIRT surface. Jeon et al.'s
  "Multidimensional Latent Space Item Response Models: A Note on the Relativity of Conditional Dependence"
  discusses how the recovered map dimension and conditional-dependence structure are only defined **relative**
  to a reference, reinforcing that `D` is a modeling choice validated by fit, not an absolute count.
- **Choosing `D`:** fit `D=1,2,3,…` and compare by BIC / WAIC / cross-validated log-likelihood (as the
  package does with BIC); interpretability usually caps at `D=2`.

## 7. Item-fit statistics

### 7.1 Orlando & Thissen (2000) S-X² with the Lord–Wingersky recursion `[V formula/df, S recursion]`

Group examinees by **observed summed score** `s∈{1,…,I-1}` (score-independent of `θ̂`). For item `i`:
$$
\boxed{\;S\text{-}X^2_i=\sum_{s=1}^{I-1} N_s\,\frac{\big(O_{is}-E_{is}\big)^2}{E_{is}\,(1-E_{is})}\;},
\qquad df = (I-1)-m_i,
$$
where `N_s` = number of examinees with summed score `s`, `O_{is}` = observed proportion correct on item `i`
in score group `s`, `E_{is}` = model-expected proportion, and `m_i` = number of estimated parameters for
item `i` (1 for Rasch, 2 for 2PL, 3 for 3PL). Score groups `0` and `I` are excluded (trivial proportions).

**Expected proportion `E_{is}`** (this is where the recursion enters):
$$
E_{is}=\frac{\displaystyle\int P_i(\theta)\,S_{s-1}^{(-i)}(\theta)\,g(\theta)\,d\theta}
{\displaystyle\int S_{s}(\theta)\,g(\theta)\,d\theta},
$$
i.e. `E_{is}=P(\text{item }i\text{ correct}\mid \text{summed score}=s)`: numerator = P(item `i` correct **and**
total `= s`) — if item `i` is correct the *other* `I-1` items must sum to `s-1`; denominator = P(total `= s`).
Both integrals are evaluated by Gauss–Hermite quadrature over `g(θ)`.

**Lord–Wingersky (1984) recursion** for the summed-score likelihood at fixed `θ`. Let
`f_r^{(n)}(θ)=P(\text{score}=r\text{ using items }1..n\mid θ)`:
$$
f_0^{(1)}=1-P_1(\theta),\quad f_1^{(1)}=P_1(\theta);\qquad
f_r^{(n)}(\theta)=f_r^{(n-1)}(\theta)\big(1-P_n(\theta)\big)+f_{r-1}^{(n-1)}(\theta)\,P_n(\theta),
$$
for `n=2,…,I` and `r=0,…,n` (with `f_r^{(n-1)}≡0` for `r<0` or `r>n-1`). Then
`S_s(θ):=f_s^{(I)}(θ)`, and `S_{s-1}^{(-i)}(θ)` is the same recursion run over the `I-1` items **excluding
item `i`**. (Compute the leave-one-out distributions by removing each item's factor.)

**Generalization.** Kang & Chen (2008) extend S-X² to polytomous / graded response models (bins on the
total summed score, cell probabilities via a generalized Lord–Wingersky recursion). The likelihood-ratio
analogue is `S-G²_i = 2 Σ_s N_s[ O_{is} ln(O_{is}/E_{is}) + (1-O_{is}) ln((1-O_{is})/(1-E_{is})) ]`.

### 7.2 Infit / Outfit mean squares (Wright & Masters, 1982) `[S/V heuristics]`

Standardized residual for the (p,i) cell (`E_{pi}=P_{pi}`, variance `W_{pi}=P_{pi}(1-P_{pi})` for
dichotomous; `W_{pi}=Σ_k (k-E_{pi})^2 P_{pik}` for polytomous):
$$
z_{pi}=\frac{y_{pi}-E_{pi}}{\sqrt{W_{pi}}}.
$$
Per-**item** fit:
$$
\text{Outfit}_i=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{p=1}^{N} z_{pi}^2
=\frac1N\sum_p \frac{(y_{pi}-E_{pi})^2}{W_{pi}},\qquad
\text{Infit}_i=\frac{\sum_{p}(y_{pi}-E_{pi})^2}{\sum_{p} W_{pi}}
=\frac{\sum_p W_{pi}z_{pi}^2}{\sum_p W_{pi}}.
$$
Per-**person** fit uses the same expressions summing over items `i` at fixed `p`. Outfit is the unweighted
mean square (sensitive to outliers on items far from a person's ability); Infit is
**information-weighted** (down-weights those extremes). Expected value ≈ 1. Optional
**Wilson–Hilferty** standardization to an approximately `N(0,1)` `t`:
$$
t=\Big(\text{MS}^{1/3}-1\Big)\frac{3}{q}+\frac{q}{3},\qquad q^2=\widehat{\operatorname{Var}}(\text{MS}).
$$

### 7.3 Posterior predictive checks (Bayesian item fit) `[S]`

Draw `y^{rep}` from the posterior predictive; discrepancy `T(y,ζ)` (e.g. item odds-ratios, item-total
correlations, χ² by score group); posterior predictive `p`-value
`ppp = P\big(T(y^{rep},ζ)\ge T(y,ζ)\mid y\big)`, estimated as the fraction of MCMC draws with
`T(y^{rep(s)},ζ^{(s)})≥T(y,ζ^{(s)})`. Values near 0 or 1 flag misfit (Sinharay, 2005). The `lsirm12pl`
`gof()` (observed vs. replicated item means; ROC/AUC) is a lightweight instance.

---

## 8. Person-fit statistics

### 8.1 `l_z` (Drasgow, Levine & Williams, 1985) `[V]`

Standardized log-likelihood of a response pattern at (estimated) ability `θ`:
$$
l(\theta)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\Big\{X_i\log\frac{P_i(\theta)}{1-P_i(\theta)}+\log\big(1-P_i(\theta)\big)\Big\},
$$
$$
l_z(\theta)=\frac{l(\theta)-E[l(\theta)]}{\sqrt{\operatorname{Var}[l(\theta)]}}
=\frac{\sum_{i}(X_i-P_i(\theta))\log\frac{P_i(\theta)}{1-P_i(\theta)}}{\sqrt{\operatorname{Var}[l(\theta)]}},
$$
with `E[l(θ)]=Σ_i[P_i\log P_i+(1-P_i)\log(1-P_i)]` and
`Var[l(θ)]=Σ_i P_i(1-P_i)\big(\log\frac{P_i}{1-P_i}\big)^2`. Under the model with **known** `θ`, `l_z ≈ N(0,1)`;
low (very negative) values flag aberrance. **Problem:** substituting `θ̂` biases the mean/variance so the
`N(0,1)` reference is wrong — corrected by `l_z^*`.

### 8.2 Snijders (2001) `l_z^*` — asymptotically correct standardization `[V]`

Snijders' general class of person-fit statistics:
`W(\theta)=Σ_{i=1}^{n}(X_i-P_i(\theta))\,w_i(\theta)` (for `l_z`, `w_i(θ)=\log\frac{P_i(θ)}{1-P_i(θ)}`).
Define, with `P_i'(θ)=dP_i/dθ` and Fisher information `I(θ)=Σ_i \frac{P_i'(θ)^2}{P_i(θ)(1-P_i(θ))}`:
$$
r_i(\theta)=\frac{P_i'(\theta)}{P_i(\theta)\{1-P_i(\theta)\}},\qquad
c(\theta)=\frac{\sum_i P_i'(\theta)\,w_i(\theta)}{\sum_i P_i'(\theta)\,r_i(\theta)}
=\frac{1}{I(\theta)}\sum_i P_i'(\theta)\,w_i(\theta),
$$
$$
\tilde w_i(\theta)=w_i(\theta)-c(\theta)\,r_i(\theta),\qquad
\tau^2(\theta)=\frac1n\sum_i \tilde w_i^2(\theta)\,P_i(\theta)\{1-P_i(\theta)\}.
$$
The corrected statistic (asymptotically `N(0,1)` even with estimated `θ̂`):
$$
\boxed{\;l_z^*=\tilde Z(\hat\theta)=\frac{W(\hat\theta)+c(\hat\theta)\,r_0(\hat\theta)}{\sqrt{n}\,\tau(\hat\theta)}\;}
$$
where the estimator-dependent term `r_0(θ̂)` is:
$$
r_0(\hat\theta)=\begin{cases}
0, & \text{MLE},\\[2pt]
\dfrac{d\log f(\hat\theta)}{d\hat\theta}, & \text{MAP (prior } f),\\[6pt]
\dfrac{J(\hat\theta)}{2\,I(\hat\theta)}, & \text{WLE (Warm), with } J(\theta)=\sum_i \dfrac{P_i'P_i''}{P_i(1-P_i)}.
\end{cases}
$$
Substituting `w_i=\log\frac{P_i}{1-P_i}` gives the corrected `l_z^*`. **Scope:** derived for dichotomous
items; the mean/variance correction absorbs the first-order effect of estimating `θ`. (Multidimensional /
polytomous / mixed-type extensions: Sinharay, 2016; and the "corrected version" note, arXiv:2605.00216,
which is the source of the formulas above.)

## 9. Item selection / removal decision procedure (grounded in cited literature)

A defensible LSIRM item-screening pipeline, combining classical fit rules with LSIRM-specific map
diagnostics. Apply after a converged fit; re-estimate after each removal round (fit indices shift).

1. **S-X² misfit, multiplicity-controlled.** Compute `S-X²_i` (§7.1) and its `p`-value for every item.
   Control the false discovery rate across items with **Benjamini–Hochberg** (1995): sort `p_{(1)}≤…≤p_{(I)}`,
   reject where `p_{(i)}≤ (i/I)·q` (`q=.05`). Flag rejected items. (S-X² is preferred over `θ̂`-binned Q₁/G²
   because its summed-score bins are model-independent; Orlando & Thissen, 2000.)
2. **Infit/Outfit out of range.** Flag items with mean squares outside a productive-misfit band.
   Wright & Linacre (1994) "reasonable" ranges: high-stakes MCQ ≈ `[0.8, 1.2]`; a common working band is
   **`[0.7, 1.3]`**; lenient `[0.5, 1.5]` (de Ayala, 2009). Values `>` upper bound (underfit) are the
   serious ones — the item is noisier than the model expects (degrades measurement); values `<` lower bound
   (overfit) are redundant but rarely harmful. Optionally use the standardized `t` with `|t|>2`, but note
   `t` is over-powered at large `N` (Bond & Fox, 2007) — prefer the mean-square band there.
3. **Low discrimination (2PL/MIRT).** Flag items with `α_i` (or `\text{MDISC}_i=\lVert a_i\rVert`) below a
   threshold (e.g. `< 0.3–0.4` on the logistic metric); such items carry little information and often
   coincide with S-X² misfit.
4. **Person-fit screen before item decisions.** Remove or down-weight aberrant respondents flagged by
   `l_z^* < -1.645` (one-sided 5%) *before* finalizing item removals, so item statistics are not distorted
   by cheating/careless patterns (Snijders, 2001; §8.2).
5. **LSIRM-specific map diagnostics.**
   - **Isolated items.** An item whose position `w_i` is far from the bulk of respondent positions `{z_p}`
     (large `γ`-weighted distance `γ·\text{mean}_p \lVert z_p-w_i\rVert`, i.e. a large interaction penalty for
     nearly everyone) discriminates poorly in the region where data live — a candidate for removal or
     rewording. This is the LSIRM reading of an item that "no one interacts with."
   - **Interaction necessity.** If, after refit, an item's removal barely changes `γ` and the map
     (or a spike-and-slab prior keeps `γ≈0` for that item), the interaction term is not needed — the item is
     adequately described by `θ_p+β_i` alone.
   - **Interaction DIF (multigroup).** Flag items whose group-specific positions differ,
     `\lVert w_i^{(g)}-w_i^{(g')}\rVert` large (§5.2).
6. **Decision.** Remove an item only when it fails **multiple** criteria (e.g. BH-significant S-X²
   **and** Infit/Outfit out of band, or low `α_i` **and** map-isolated), and when removal is substantively
   defensible (content coverage preserved). Document each removal and re-run item- and person-fit on the
   reduced set. Prefer revision over deletion when content is essential.

---

## 10. Minimal implementation checklist

- **Likelihood kernel:** `logit⁻¹(θ_p+β_i−γ‖z_p−w_i‖)` (binary) or Gaussian mean (continuous); cache
  distances `d_{pi}` and unit vectors `u_{pi}`.
- **Estimator:** MH-RM (§3.C) as the default MML engine (handles the `(1+D)`-dim per-person + `D`-dim
  per-item latents without quadrature blow-up); JML (§3.B) for a warm start; Bock–Aitkin quadrature
  (§3.A.1) only for the `D`-free trait margin / plain 2PL calibration.
- **Identifiability each iteration:** center `Z, W`; Procrustes-rotate `W` to a fixed reference `W₀`;
  fix `γ` scale or standardize position variance. Anchor `≥ D+1` items for multigroup comparability.
- **Variance components:** update `σ², σ_ε²` (and multilevel `σ_α², τ², Ψ_z`) by random-effects EM moment
  equations / conjugate draws.
- **Fit module:** S-X² via Lord–Wingersky recursion (§7.1); Infit/Outfit (§7.2); `l_z^*` (§8.2);
  posterior-predictive checks if a Bayesian variant is also run.
- **Screening:** the §9 pipeline with BH-FDR on S-X² and a `[0.7,1.3]` mean-square band.

## 14. Monte Carlo EM (MCEM)

### 14.1 The MCEM E-step approximation (Wei & Tanner, 1990) `[V]`

Replace the E-step expectation `Q(ξ\mid ξ^{(k)})=E[ℓ_c(ξ;y,X)\mid y,ξ^{(k)}]` by a (possibly weighted)
Monte Carlo average. With `X_1,…,X_M` sampled (not necessarily iid) from `f(x\mid y;ξ^{(k)})`:
$$
\boxed{\;\hat Q(\xi\mid\xi^{(k)})=\sum_{s=1}^{M} w_s\,\ell_c(\xi;\,y,X_s)\;}
\qquad\Big(\text{iid case: } w_s=\tfrac1M\Big),
$$
then M-step `ξ^{(k+1)}=\arg\max_ξ \hat Q(ξ\mid ξ^{(k)})`. (Verbatim as Eq. 19 of the MCEM review,
arXiv:2401.00945, which is the verification source used throughout §14.) The complete-data gradient and
Hessian are the same mixtures, so at convergence the observed information follows from **Louis (1982)**:
generate one final large sample and estimate
`I(ξ̂) = −E[∇²ℓ_c\mid y] − Var[S_c\mid y]` by its Monte Carlo averages. Wei & Tanner's own convergence
recommendation: plot `ξ^{(k)}` across iterations; when the trajectory stabilizes, either stop or increase
`M` and continue until it stabilizes again (this "increase `M` late" heuristic is the primitive form of
every scheduling rule below).

For LSIRM (§3.A.2): `x = (θ_p, z_p)_{p=1..N}`, the per-person integrals factorize, so the E-step samples
each person's posterior independently — `N` parallel `(1+D)`-dimensional problems, never a `Q^{1+D}` grid.

### 14.2 Sampling variants for the E-step

**(a) Posterior sampling by MCMC (McCulloch, 1997) `[V description / S details]`.**
For GLMMs — the model class closest to LSIRM's random-effects margin — draw `u^{(1)},…,u^{(M)}` from
`f(u\mid y;ξ^{(k)})` with a Metropolis–Hastings chain (one-coordinate-at-a-time random walk), then use
equal weights in `\hat Q`. McCulloch (1997, JASA 92, 162–170) compares this MCEM with a Monte Carlo
Newton–Raphson (MCNR) and Monte Carlo maximum likelihood (MCML; Geyer, 1991): MCEM/MCNR beat MCML alone;
MCEM-then-one-MCML-step was best. His schedule (verified): fixed `M`, increased at iterations 20 and 40 —
i.e., a Wei–Tanner-style hand-tuned schedule.

**(b) Importance sampling from a posterior approximation (Booth & Hobert, 1999) `[V use / S proposal details]`.**
Draw iid `X_s ∼ h(x)` and weight
$$
w_s=\frac{\tilde w_s}{\sum_{s'}\tilde w_{s'}},\qquad
\tilde w_s=\frac{f(X_s\mid y;\xi^{(k)})}{h(X_s)}
\;\propto\;\frac{f(y\mid X_s;\xi^{(k)})\,g(X_s)}{h(X_s)},
$$
(self-normalization removes the unknown normalizing constant `f(y)`). Booth & Hobert's proposal `h` is a
multivariate Student-`t` matched to the Laplace approximation of the posterior (mode + curvature) `[S]`.
They also tried rejection sampling; importance sampling was faster with similar results `[V]`.

**(c) Importance sampling from the prior (the "cheap" variant) `[S]`.**
Take `h(x)=g(x)` (the latent prior, e.g. `φ(θ_p)φ_D(z_p)` for LSIRM). Then `\tilde w_s = f(y\mid X_s;ξ^{(k)})`
— pure **likelihood weights**, no posterior approximation needed. Trade-off: weights degenerate as the
posterior concentrates away from the prior (long tests, extreme respondents); effective sample size
`ESS = 1/\sum_s w_s^2` should be monitored, and (b) preferred when `ESS/M` is small. This prior-sampling
variant is what plugs most directly into a QMC point set (§15.5), because prior draws are transformations
of uniforms.

### 14.3 Automated sample-size scheduling and stopping (Booth & Hobert, 1999) `[V]`

Frame iteration `k` as M-estimation of the **deterministic EM update** `\tilde ξ_k` (what EM would have
produced from `ξ̂_{k-1}` with an exact E-step). As `M_k→∞`,
$$
\sqrt{M_k}\,(\hat\xi_k-\tilde\xi_k)=
-\sqrt{M_k}\Big[\nabla^2 Q(\tilde\xi_k\mid\hat\xi_{k-1})\Big]^{-1}
\Big[\nabla\hat Q(\tilde\xi_k\mid\hat\xi_{k-1})\Big]+o_p(1),
$$
so `ξ̂_k` is asymptotically normal with (estimable) sandwich covariance
$$
\widehat{\operatorname{Var}}(\hat\xi_k)\approx\frac{1}{M_k}
\Big[\nabla^2\hat Q(\hat\xi_k\mid\hat\xi_{k-1})\Big]^{-1}
\hat E\big[S_c(\hat\xi_k)S_c(\hat\xi_k)^{\!\top}\mid y\big]
\Big[\nabla^2\hat Q(\hat\xi_k\mid\hat\xi_{k-1})\Big]^{-1}
$$
(no centering term: `ξ̂_k` maximizes `\hat Q`). Rules:

- **Sample-size increase.** Build a `100(1-α)%` confidence ellipsoid (or componentwise intervals) for
  `\tilde ξ_k`. If it **contains** `ξ̂_{k-1}` — the step is indistinguishable from Monte Carlo noise — set
  $$
  \boxed{\;M_{k+1}=M_k+\Big\lfloor \tfrac{M_k}{r}\Big\rfloor = M_k\big(1+\tfrac1r\big),\qquad r\in\{3,4,5\}\;}
  $$
  and proceed to the next iteration (Booth–Hobert increase *between* iterations; contrast §14.4).
  Start with a **small** `M_1` (tens).
- **Stopping (convergence assessment = MC error vs EM increment).** Terminate when the relative parameter
  change is small for **three consecutive iterations**:
  $$
  \max_j\left|\frac{\hat\xi_{k,j}-\hat\xi_{k-1,j}}{\hat\xi_{k-1,j}+\delta_1}\right|<\delta_2,
  \qquad \delta_1=10^{-3},\ \ \delta_2\in(2\times10^{-3},\,5\times10^{-3}).
  $$
  Alternative (variance components near a boundary): replace the denominator by
  `SE(ξ̂_{k,j})+δ_1'` with tolerance `δ_2'`.

### 14.4 Ascent-based MCEM (Caffo, Jank & Jones, 2005) `[V]`

Quantify MC uncertainty in the **objective increment** rather than the parameter. With
`ΔQ̂ = \hat Q(ξ̂_k\mid ξ̂_{k-1}) − \hat Q(ξ̂_{k-1}\mid ξ̂_{k-1})`,
`\sqrt{M_k}(ΔQ̂−ΔQ) ⇝ N(0,Σ_k)`. Rules: (i) if the **lower** `(1-α)` confidence bound for `ΔQ` is not
positive, augment the sample **at the current iteration** (add `M_k/r` points) and re-test — this
stochastically preserves the EM ascent property; (ii) terminate when the **upper** confidence bound for
`ΔQ` falls below a tolerance `τ` (e.g. `10^{-3}`); (iii) start the next iteration with at least the final
`M_k`. Under importance sampling, `Σ_k` needs a Delta-method estimate (self-normalized weights).
Empirically (verified): slightly worse than Booth–Hobert per unit compute for point estimates, better for
the information matrix, and most of the compute lands in the final iteration — whose sample is then reused
for Louis standard errors.

### 14.5 MCEM for item factor analysis (Meng & Schilling, 1996) `[~]`

For the full-information item factor model (multidimensional normal-ogive — the compensatory cousin of
the inner-product LSIRM, §6.2), Meng & Schilling implement the MC E-step with a **Gibbs sampler**: augment
with the underlying continuous responses and factor scores, alternate truncated-normal draws of the
augmented responses and multivariate-normal draws of factor scores, and average complete-data sufficient
statistics over the chain. Two MCEM implementations are given; both recover high-dimensional loadings
where fixed-point Gauss–Hermite quadrature (Bock–Aitkin) degrades — the historical proof-of-concept that
sampling-based E-steps break the quadrature curse for item-level models. Bridge sampling is used to
compute observed-data likelihood ratios for monitoring. (Existence, venue, and method description verified;
sampler equations from memory.) JASA 91(435), 1254–1267.

### 14.6 Which rule to use (synthesis) `[V — review's comparisons]`

- Default: **Booth–Hobert** (§14.3) with importance sampling; simplest automated rule, fast convergence.
- If ascent guarantees / information estimates matter: **Caffo et al.** (§14.4).
- If the posterior is only reachable by MCMC (LSIRM with `D≥2`: MH on `(θ_p,z_p)`): McCulloch-style MCEM,
  but then the iid-based variance formulas of §14.3–14.4 need batch-means/replicate corrections — or
  switch to MH-RM (§3.C), which was designed for exactly this and needs no growing `M_k`.

---

## 15. Quasi-Monte Carlo EM (QMC-EM)

### 15.1 Error rates: why QMC `[S]`

Plain MC has probabilistic root-`M` error: `|\hat I_M − I| = O_p(M^{-1/2})`. QMC replaces random draws by a
deterministic **low-discrepancy** point set `{x_1,…,x_M}⊂[0,1)^K` and obeys the **Koksma–Hlawka** bound
$$
\Big|\frac1M\sum_{s=1}^M f(x_s)-\int_{[0,1)^K}\!f(u)\,du\Big|
\;\le\; V_{HK}(f)\; D_M^{*},
$$
with `V_{HK}` the Hardy–Krause variation and `D_M^*` the star discrepancy. Halton and Sobol' sequences
achieve
$$
D_M^{*}=O\!\big(M^{-1}(\log M)^{K}\big)
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
\text{error } O\!\big(M^{-1}(\log M)^{K}\big)\ \text{vs. MC } O(M^{-1/2}),
$$
i.e. nearly rate-1 for the small `K` relevant here (`K = 1+D` per person for LSIRM). (Niederreiter, 1992;
Caflisch, 1998.) Owen-scrambled nets attain `O(M^{-3/2}(\log M)^{(K-1)/2})` RMS error for smooth `f` `[S]`.

### 15.2 Halton construction (radical inverse) `[V]`

Write `n` in base `b`: `n=\sum_{j\ge0} a_j(n)\,b^{\,j}`, digits `a_j∈{0,…,b-1}`. The **radical inverse**
mirrors the digits about the radix point:
$$
\boxed{\;\phi_b(n)=\sum_{j\ge0} a_j(n)\,b^{-(j+1)}\;}\in[0,1).
$$
The `K`-dimensional **Halton point** uses the first `K` primes `b_1=2,b_2=3,b_3=5,…` (pairwise coprime
bases are what guarantee low discrepancy):
$$
x_n=\big(\phi_{b_1}(n),\,\phi_{b_2}(n),\,\dots,\,\phi_{b_K}(n)\big),\qquad n=1,2,\dots,M.
$$
Example (verified): `n=6=110_2 → φ_2(6)=0.011_2=3/8`. For `K ≳ 10` use Sobol' or leaped/scrambled Halton
instead — plain Halton's high-base coordinates correlate badly `[S]`.

### 15.3 Randomized QMC (RQMC): getting an error estimate back `[V rationale / S formulas]`

Deterministic QMC has no internal error estimate — fatal for the automated rules of §14.3–14.4, which is
precisely the problem Jank (2005) solves `[V]`: randomize the point set, run `R` independent
randomizations, and use the between-replicate variance.

- **Random shift (Cranley–Patterson) `[S]`:** draw one `U∼\text{Unif}[0,1)^K`, set
  $$
  \tilde x_n=(x_n+U)\bmod 1\ \ (\text{componentwise}),\qquad n=1,\dots,M.
  $$
  Each `\tilde x_n` is marginally uniform ⇒ the RQMC estimator is **unbiased**; the point set keeps its
  low discrepancy.
- **Random-start Halton / digit scrambling (Owen) `[S]`:** randomize the starting index or apply random
  permutations to the digits `a_j(n)` per base; scrambling additionally buys the `M^{-3/2}` rate for
  smooth integrands.
- **Error estimate `[S]`:** with `R` independent randomizations (`R` small, 5–25) yielding estimates
  `\hat I^{(1)},…,\hat I^{(R)}`,
  $$
  \hat I_{RQMC}=\frac1R\sum_r \hat I^{(r)},\qquad
  \widehat{\operatorname{Var}}(\hat I_{RQMC})=\frac{1}{R(R-1)}\sum_{r}\big(\hat I^{(r)}-\hat I_{RQMC}\big)^2 .
  $$
  This variance plugs directly into the Booth–Hobert ellipsoid / Caffo bounds, replacing the iid formulas.

### 15.4 Uniform → Gaussian: inverse-normal transform

QMC points must pass through `Φ^{-1}` **coordinatewise** (never Box–Muller, which scrambles the
low-discrepancy structure `[S]`): `z_n=Φ^{-1}(\tilde x_n)`, then map to the sampling density, e.g. prior
draws `θ = μ + σ z` or `(θ_p,z_p) = m_{Lap} + C_{Lap}^{1/2} z` for the Laplace-matched proposal of §14.2(b).

**Acklam's algorithm for `Φ^{-1}(p)` `[V — all coefficients verified]`.** Max relative error
`1.15×10^{-9}`. Break-points `p_{low}=0.02425`, `p_{high}=1-p_{low}`.

- Central region `p∈[p_{low},p_{high}]`: with `q=p-\tfrac12`, `r=q^2`,
  $$
  \Phi^{-1}(p)\approx\frac{(((((a_1r+a_2)r+a_3)r+a_4)r+a_5)r+a_6)\,q}{((((b_1r+b_2)r+b_3)r+b_4)r+b_5)r+1}.
  $$
- Lower tail `0<p<p_{low}`: with `q=\sqrt{-2\ln p}`,
  $$
  \Phi^{-1}(p)\approx\frac{(((((c_1q+c_2)q+c_3)q+c_4)q+c_5)q+c_6)}{(((d_1q+d_2)q+d_3)q+d_4)q+1};
  $$
  upper tail `p>p_{high}`: same with `q=\sqrt{-2\ln(1-p)}` and overall sign flipped.

Optional full-double-precision polish (one Halley step) `[S]`:
`e=Φ(x)-p`, `u=e\sqrt{2\pi}\,e^{x^2/2}`, `x \leftarrow x-u/(1+xu/2)`.

**Beasley–Springer–Moro (BSM) `[S]`:** the alternative used throughout computational finance —
Beasley–Springer rational approximation on the center, Moro's Chebyshev-in-`\log(-\log)` tails; the
standard coefficient tables live in Glasserman (2004, *Monte Carlo Methods in Financial Engineering*,
§2.3.2) and Moro (1995, *Risk* 8(2)). Accuracy ≈ `3×10^{-9}` absolute; Acklam is the simpler drop-in.

### 15.5 The QMC-EM recipe (Jank, 2005) `[V design / S assembled steps]`

Jank (2005, CSDA 48, 685–701): take the automated MCEM of §14.3 and swap the iid uniforms for RQMC.
Verified findings: RQMC-EM is "much more efficient than ordinary Monte Carlo … with fixed computational
effort, even after dividing this computational budget among multiple independent runs … to facilitate
variance estimation."

Per EM iteration `k`, for each person `p` (LSIRM: `K=1+D`):

1. Generate the Halton (or Sobol') points `x_1,…,x_{M_k}∈[0,1)^K` (§15.2) — **reuse the same base set
   across iterations**; only the randomization changes.
2. Randomize `R` times: shifts `U^{(1)},…,U^{(R)}` → `\tilde x_n^{(r)}` (§15.3).
3. Transform: `z_n^{(r)}=Φ^{-1}(\tilde x_n^{(r)})` (§15.4), map to draws of `(θ_p,z_p)` from the proposal
   `h` (prior, §14.2(c), or Laplace-matched, §14.2(b)).
4. Importance weights `w` as in §14.2; form `\hat Q^{(r)}`, average to `\hat Q`, and estimate the MC error
   from the spread of the `R` replicates (§15.3).
5. Apply the Booth–Hobert ellipsoid rule with the RQMC variance: grow `M_k` by `(1+1/r)` when the update
   drowns in MC error; stop on the three-consecutive relative-change rule (§14.3). Because the RQMC error
   decays ≈`M^{-1}` instead of `M^{-1/2}`, the schedule reaches the same tolerance with far smaller `M`.

**QMC inside IRT/GLMM likelihoods `[V existence]`:** Pan & Thompson (2007, CSDA 51, 5765–5775) use
randomized QMC point sets to approximate the GLMM marginal likelihood directly (the same integral as an
IRT random-effects margin) and report efficiency gains over GHQ/MC; González et al.'s work on QMC for IRT
connects the same grid idea to latent-trait models. No LSIRM-specific QMC paper was found — §15.5 is the
assembly, flagged as such.

### 15.6 Cross-reference: MH-RM vs (Q)MC-EM `[S synthesis]`

MH-RM (§3.C; Cai, 2010) attacks the same integral by **averaging over iterations** (Robbins–Monro gains
`ε_t=1/t`, `Σε_t=∞`, `Σε_t²<∞`) with `M≈1` draw per iteration; (Q)MC-EM attacks it by making each
iteration's integral accurate. Rule of thumb: MH-RM when only MCMC sampling is available and the parameter
count is large (full LSIRM); QMC-EM when iid/importance sampling from a good proposal is possible and
high-precision EM steps (e.g. for FIPC's few free parameters, §18) are wanted.

---

## 16. IRT scoring — exact estimators

Throughout: response pattern `y=(y_1,…,y_n)`, pattern likelihood
`L(y\mid θ)=∏_i T_i(y_i\mid θ)`, scoring prior `g(θ)` (items fixed at calibrated values).

### 16.1 EAP (Bock & Mislevy, 1982) `[~ — description verified; formulas standard]`

Posterior mean and SD by quadrature (`Q` equally-spaced or Gauss–Hermite points; Bock–Mislevy: evaluation
is non-iterative, likelihoods accumulate by summing log terms item by item):
$$
\hat\theta^{EAP}=\frac{\sum_{q=1}^{Q}X_q\,L(y\mid X_q)\,A_q}{\sum_{q=1}^{Q}L(y\mid X_q)\,A_q},
\qquad
PSD=\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{q}(X_q-\hat\theta^{EAP})^2\,L(y\mid X_q)\,A_q}{\sum_{q}L(y\mid X_q)\,A_q}} .
$$
`A_q` = prior weights (`g(X_q)` normalized, or GH weights). PSD is used interchangeably with the SE
(verified claim of the paper). Exists for every pattern (incl. all-0/all-1); shrinks toward the prior mean.

### 16.2 MAP (Bayes modal) `[S]`

Maximize `\ell_{post}(θ)=\log L(y\mid θ)+\log g(θ)` by Newton–Raphson:
$$
\theta^{(t+1)}=\theta^{(t)}-\frac{\ell_{post}'(\theta^{(t)})}{\ell_{post}''(\theta^{(t)})},
\qquad
SE(\hat\theta^{MAP})=\Big[-\ell_{post}''(\hat\theta^{MAP})\Big]^{-1/2}.
$$
For the logistic 2PL with `g=N(μ,σ²)`:
`\ell_{post}'(θ)=\sum_i a_i\,(y_i-P_i(θ))-(θ-μ)/σ²` and (exactly, since `∂P_i/∂θ = a_iP_iQ_i`)
`\ell_{post}''(θ)=-\sum_i a_i^2P_i(θ)Q_i(θ)-1/σ²`, so
$$
SE(\hat\theta^{MAP})=\Big[\textstyle\sum_i a_i^2P_iQ_i+\sigma^{-2}\Big]^{-1/2}
=\big[I(\hat\theta)+\sigma^{-2}\big]^{-1/2}.
$$
(For 3PL/polytomous the observed Hessian depends on `y`; use the observed one, not `I(θ)`.) Multidimensional:
same Newton step with gradient/Hessian vectors; `SE` from the negative inverse Hessian's diagonal.

### 16.3 Summed-score EAP — "EAPsum" (Thissen, Pommerich, Billeaud & Williams, 1995; Cai, 2015) `[V]`

**Lord & Wingersky (1984) recursion — exact statement `[V, verbatim from Cai 2015, Eq. 8]`.**
Let `L_n(s\mid θ)` be the summed-score likelihood over items `1..n`. Initialize
`L_1(0\mid θ)=T_1(0\mid θ)`, `L_1(1\mid θ)=T_1(1\mid θ)`. For `i=2,…,n`:
$$
\boxed{\;
\begin{aligned}
L_i(0\mid\theta)&=L_{i-1}(0\mid\theta)\,T_i(0\mid\theta),\\
L_i(s\mid\theta)&=L_{i-1}(s\mid\theta)\,T_i(0\mid\theta)+L_{i-1}(s-1\mid\theta)\,T_i(1\mid\theta),
\quad s=1,\dots,i-1,\\
L_i(i\mid\theta)&=L_{i-1}(i-1\mid\theta)\,T_i(1\mid\theta).
\end{aligned}\;}
$$
(Identical to Part I §7.1's `f_r^{(n)}`; now verified verbatim.) **Polytomous generalization**
(Thissen et al., 1995) `[S statement / V existence]`: item `i` with categories `k=0,…,m_i` scored `k`:
$$
L_i(s\mid\theta)=\sum_{k=0}^{m_i} T_i(k\mid\theta)\,L_{i-1}(s-k\mid\theta),
$$
zero terms for `s-k` out of range; total cost `O\big(n\cdot S_{max}\cdot\max m_i\big)` per `θ` node.

**Summed-score posterior and EAP `[V, Cai 2015 Eqs. 4–7]`.** Write `L(s\mid θ)=L_n(s\mid θ)`:
$$
p(s)=\int L(s\mid\theta)\,g(\theta)\,d\theta,\qquad
p(\theta\mid s)=\frac{L(s\mid\theta)\,g(\theta)}{p(s)},
$$
$$
\boxed{\;
EAP(s)=E(\theta\mid s)=\frac{1}{p(s)}\int\theta\,L(s\mid\theta)\,g(\theta)\,d\theta,\qquad
SD(s)=\sqrt{\frac{1}{p(s)}\int\theta^2L(s\mid\theta)\,g(\theta)\,d\theta-\big[EAP(s)\big]^2}\;}
$$
all integrals by the same quadrature as §16.1 (`∫ → Σ_q`, `g(θ)dθ → A_q`).

**Score-conversion-table serving pattern `[V — Cai 2015; mirt::fscores(method="EAPsum")]`.**
Because `EAP(s)` depends only on `s`, precompute once per (form × prior) the table
`{s ↦ (EAP(s), SD(s), p(s))}` for `s=0,…,S_{max}`; scoring is then an `O(1)` lookup — no per-respondent
IRT computation, the standard operational pattern for reported scale scores. `Σ_s p(s)=1` is a free
self-check of the recursion. In `mirt`, `fscores(method="EAPsum", full.scores=FALSE)` returns exactly this
table; custom priors enter via `mean`/`cov` (or `custom_den`) — the hook for §16.4. Missing data: a table
presumes a fixed item set; respondents with omits need pattern-EAP (§16.1) or a table for their sub-form.

### 16.4 Group-specific and multilevel priors in scoring `[S]`

**Multiple group (Bock & Zimowski, 1997 margin, §5.1).** Replace `g(θ)` by the examinee's group density
`φ(θ;μ_g,σ_g²)` everywhere in §16.1–16.3:
$$
\hat\theta^{EAP}_{p}= \frac{\sum_q X_q\,L(y_p\mid X_q)\,\phi(X_q;\mu_g,\sigma_g^2)}
{\sum_q L(y_p\mid X_q)\,\phi(X_q;\mu_g,\sigma_g^2)},
$$
and one EAPsum table **per group** (same `L(s\mid θ)`, different prior — recompute only the weights).
This is the correct Bayes score when group membership is known and `(μ_g,σ_g)` were estimated in
calibration; ignoring it biases scores of off-reference groups toward the reference mean.

**Multilevel (random intercept; §4.2 model).** `θ_{pc}=μ+u_c+e_{pc}`, `u_c∼N(0,σ_u²)`, `e_{pc}∼N(0,σ_e²)`,
cluster `c=c(p)`:
- **Cluster unknown / marginal scoring:** integrate `u_c` out ⇒ prior `θ_{pc}∼N(μ,\ σ_u²+σ_e²)`;
  with the usual `σ_e²=1` normalization this is the `N(μ,\,1+σ_u²)` prior — wider, so less shrinkage.
- **Cluster effect known / conditional scoring:** given `û_c` (posterior mean of the cluster effect from
  the calibration run), use `θ_{pc}∼N(μ+û_c,\ σ_e²)` — a shifted, **narrower** prior that borrows strength
  from clustermates (school-conditioned EAP). The choice is consequential: conditional scoring shrinks a
  student toward *their school's* mean, marginal scoring toward the *grand* mean; report which is used.
- LSIRM/HLSIRM analogue: score `(θ_p,z_p)` jointly with prior `N(α_{(k)},σ²_{(k)})×MVN(z_{(k)},Ψ_z)`
  (conditional) or with the school-latents integrated out (marginal), via the same MC/QMC machinery of
  §14–15 since the posterior is `(1+D)`-dimensional.

## 17. Concurrent calibration (multiple forms, common-item design)

### 17.1 Definition `[S formulation / V descriptions]`

Groups/forms `g=1,…,G` share **anchor** (common) items; each form also has unique items. Stack all data in
one response matrix with **structural missingness** — item `i` not presented to person `p` contributes
nothing (not-presented ≠ wrong). One MML run estimates all item parameters **and** the group densities
jointly on a single scale:
$$
L\big(\{a_i,b_i,c_i\}_{i=1}^{I},\{\mu_g,\sigma_g\}_{g=2}^{G}\big)
=\prod_{g=1}^{G}\prod_{p\in g}\ \int \prod_{i\in \mathcal I_p} T_i(y_{pi}\mid\theta)\;
\phi(\theta;\mu_g,\sigma_g^2)\,d\theta,
$$
`\mathcal I_p` = items actually presented to `p`; identification `μ_1=0, σ_1=1` (reference group), all
other `(μ_g,σ_g)` **freed** — fixing them at `(0,1)` would misestimate anchors when populations differ.
Anchor items appear in `\mathcal I_p` for several groups; that overlap is the only thing tying the scale.
E-step = §3.A.1 with group-specific weights `A_q^{(g)}` from `φ(θ;μ_g,σ_g²)` (Part I §5.1 likelihood);
M-step pools expected counts `\bar r_{iq}, \bar N_q` **across groups** for anchors; group updates by
posterior moments (same equations as §18.3). This is `mirt::multipleGroup` with anchor equality
constraints + freed group means/variances, or BILOG-MG/IRTPRO multigroup runs.

### 17.2 Evidence: concurrent vs separate + linking `[V]`

- **Hanson & Béguin (2002, APM 26, 3–24):** simulation, common-item nonequivalent groups, 2PL/3PL.
  Concurrent calibration **generally produced lower error** in anchor-parameter recovery than separate
  calibration followed by Stocking–Lord/Haebara/moment linking — because anchors are estimated from
  **both** groups' responses at once. Caveat retained from their discussion: the advantage assumes the IRT
  model fits; separate calibration is more robust to (and more diagnostic of) multidimensionality and
  parameter drift, since linking can be checked item by item.
- **Kim & Cohen (1998, APM 22, 131–143):** with **few** common items, separate estimation with
  characteristic-curve (Stocking–Lord) linking gave **smaller** RMSD for `a` and `b` than concurrent;
  with **larger** anchor sets the methods were similar.
- Working rule: prefer concurrent when the anchor set is healthy (≳15–20 items or ≳20% of the form),
  model fit is acceptable, and drift screening (Part I §5.1 DIF logic on anchors) is done first; fall back
  to separate + Stocking–Lord with a thin or suspect anchor.

## 18. Fixed Item Parameter Calibration (FIPC)

### 18.1 Setup `[V]`

New-form data only. Partition items: **fixed** set `F` (anchors, parameters frozen at their old-scale
values — this *is* the linking; no transformation is computed) and **free** set `E` (new items). Estimate
(i) new-item parameters and (ii) the new population density `g_{new}(θ)` — at minimum `(μ_{new},σ_{new})`
— by MML on the fixed items' scale. Kang & Petersen (2012, APER 13, 311–321) `[V]`: FIPC is the third
standard linking route beside concurrent and separate+linking, and its adequacy **hinges on implementation**
— BILOG-MG's default never updates the prior (an NWU method), PARSCALE updates it repeatedly (MWU).

### 18.2 The five Kim (2006) variants `[V — variant definitions and findings]`

Two design axes: how often the **prior weights** (latent density estimate) are updated, and how many
**EM cycles** run.

| Variant | Prior-weight updates | EM cycles | Mechanics |
|---|---|---|---|
| NWU-OEM | never (prior stays `N(0,1)`/initial) | 1 | one E-step **using only the fixed items**, one M-step for new items (Wainer–Mislevy OEM logic) |
| NWU-MEM | never | many | E-steps use **all** items; M-steps update new items only; prior frozen |
| OWU-OEM | once | 1 | first E-step (fixed items) re-estimates the prior weights; second E-step + single M-step for new items |
| OWU-MEM | once | many | as OWU-OEM, then full EM cycles with the once-updated, then-frozen prior |
| MWU-MEM | **every cycle** | many | full EM; prior weights re-estimated from the posterior at each cycle |

Verified findings: only **MWU-MEM** recovered item parameters and the ability scale properly under all
tested new-population densities (`N(0,1)`, `N(0.5,1.2²)`, `N(1,1.4²)`); the other four under-estimated
(some severely) once the new population departed from `N(0,1)`. NWU-MEM/OWU-MEM were adequate only at
`N(0,1)`. ⇒ **Implement MWU-MEM.** `mirt::fixedCalib(method = "MWU-MEM")` implements all five with an
**empirical-histogram** density update `[V]`; Kim (2020, JEM 57, 10.1111/jedm.12230) extends two variants
to the bifactor model `[V existence]`. An "aFIPC" variant was **not** found online (see verification
summary).

### 18.3 Exact MWU-MEM recipe in a Bock–Aitkin EM `[S update equations / V architecture]`

Quadrature nodes `X_q` fixed on the **old scale**. Prior weights `A_q^{(0)}` initialized from `N(0,1)`
(or the old calibration's density). Cycle `t`:

1. **E-step (all items).** Posterior node weights per person, using fixed values for `i∈F` and current
   estimates for `i∈E`:
   $$
   P^{(t)}(X_q\mid y_p)=\frac{L_p(X_q)\,A_q^{(t)}}{\sum_{q'}L_p(X_{q'})\,A_{q'}^{(t)}},\qquad
   \bar N_q=\sum_p P^{(t)}(X_q\mid y_p),\quad \bar r_{iq}=\sum_p y_{pi}\,P^{(t)}(X_q\mid y_p).
   $$
2. **M-step (free items only).** Solve the §3.A.1 weighted-binomial likelihood equations for `i∈E`;
   **skip every `i∈F`** (their gradient contributions are simply never applied).
3. **Prior update (the "WU").** Empirical-histogram update, optionally summarized by moments:
   $$
   A_q^{(t+1)}=\frac{\bar N_q}{N},\qquad
   \hat\mu^{(t+1)}=\sum_q X_q\,A_q^{(t+1)},\qquad
   \hat\sigma^{2\,(t+1)}=\sum_q\big(X_q-\hat\mu^{(t+1)}\big)^2 A_q^{(t+1)}.
   $$
   Keep the discrete `A_q` (empirical histogram, Mislevy 1984; what `mirt::fixedCalib` does `[V]`) or refit
   `A_q^{(t+1)} ∝ φ(X_q;\hatμ,\hatσ²)` (normal-constrained update). **Do not** restandardize to `N(0,1)` —
   the whole point is that `(μ,σ)` drift to the new population while `F` pins the scale.
4. Iterate 1–3 to joint convergence of new-item parameters and `(μ̂,σ̂)` (or `{A_q}`). The other four
   variants are obtained by freezing step 3 always (NWU), after one execution (OWU), and/or truncating to
   one cycle (OEM).

Report `(μ̂_{new},σ̂_{new})` — it is the population-drift estimate — and screen `F` for drift beforehand
(misfitting anchors corrupt the scale exactly as in §17.2).
