"""Signed-slope recovery for the Rust-backed unidimensional GRM estimator.

Samejima's (1969) graded response model defines the discrimination ``a_i`` as a
real-valued slope, not a positive-constrained one: an item whose responses
relate inversely to the latent variable has a NEGATIVE slope, and that is a
different statement from an item that carries no information about the latent
variable (slope near zero). A scale with mixed item direction - a reverse-keyed
subset alongside forward-keyed items - depends on the estimator preserving that
distinction, because collapsing a reverse-keyed item onto ``0`` would report it
as uninformative instead of as inverted.

``fit_grm`` documents slopes as unconstrained. These tests pin that contract on
the public surface so a future positivity-preserving parameterization (exp or
softplus link, a clamp, an optimiser lower bound, or a starting-value floor)
cannot be introduced silently.

Model
-----
``P(Y >= k | theta) = logistic(a_i * theta + beta_ik)`` with strictly decreasing
boundary intercepts ``beta_i``, the package-native form documented by
``fit_grm`` and implemented in ``mlsirm_core::grm``.
