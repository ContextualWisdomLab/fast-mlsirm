"""Full-information item factor model stability via the Bayes loading constraint.

Full-information item factor analysis estimates a multidimensional IRT/factor
model by marginal maximum likelihood over the latent distribution (Bock,
Gibbons, & Muraki, 1988, *Applied Psychological Measurement, 12*, 261-280). That
paper reports a specific stability requirement: **"Bayes constraints on the
factor loadings are found to be necessary to suppress Heywood cases."** A Heywood
case is a loading/discrimination driven toward divergence (an out-of-range
communality / negative unique variance) by a near-deterministic response
configuration, which an unconstrained full-information fit will chase.

fast-mlsirm's MAP penalty on the discrimination parameter (``lambda_alpha``) *is*
that Bayes constraint. This test pins the paper's property on a two-factor,
simple-structure model whose first-factor items form a near-perfect Guttman
scalogram (the Heywood trigger): as the Bayes constraint strengthens, the largest
loading magnitude is suppressed monotonically and every estimate stays finite, so
the fit never runs off to a Heywood divergence. No existing test covers this
loading-suppression stability property (``test_irt_stability.py`` and the
recovery suite exercise identified, well-conditioned fits).

The property is backend-independent (the Rust/NumPy parity gate keeps both cores
numerically identical); the NumPy reference backend is pinned here for exact,
deterministic reproducibility of the reported loading magnitudes.
