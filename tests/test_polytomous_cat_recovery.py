"""Accuracy, uncertainty-calibration, and efficiency recovery for polytomous CAT.

A GRM bank is calibrated from synthetic responses and then passed to
``cat_simulate_polytomous`` for examinees with known true abilities. The test
requires bounded bias/MAE/RMSE, calibrated Rust-returned posterior uncertainty,
and materially fewer administered items than the full bank. Correlation remains
supplementary: a highly correlated CAT can still be biased or understate score
uncertainty, while a silent fallback to non-adaptive item order can still meet
score-recovery bounds.

Dodd, De Ayala, and Koch (1995) evaluate computerized adaptive testing with
polytomous IRT items and motivate measuring adaptive efficiency together with
score quality. This regression uses the package's Rust-owned item-information,
selection, scoring, posterior-SD, and stopping path; Python only generates the
synthetic GRM responses and summarizes recovery against known simulation truth.
The interval ``theta_eap ± 1.96 * theta_sd`` is an explicit normal approximation
based on the returned posterior mean and posterior SD, not a claim of an exact
posterior credible interval.

# version bump while still catching a real regression in recovery,
# uncertainty calibration, or the adaptive-selection efficiency CAT exists

# MAX_MEAN_ITEMS_USED is deliberately close to the measured ~8.7 (not a

# correlation bounds -- so a bound of 12 is what actually catches a silent
# fallback to non-adaptive selection.
