"""Robustness of the SE machinery when the information matrix is degenerate.

Standard-error reporting (the ``SE = TRUE`` path) must stay finite even when the
observed information matrix is not the textbook positive-definite matrix found at
a well-identified maximum:

* **Singular / rank-deficient information** signals that a parameter (or a linear
  combination of parameters) is not *locally identified*: the model's local
  identification is equivalent to a nonsingular information matrix (Rothenberg,
  1971, *Econometrica*, 39, 577-591). A plain inverse does not exist, so the
  variance-covariance matrix is only defined through a generalized inverse; the
  Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse is the minimum-norm choice (Penrose, 1955,
  *Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society*, 51,
  406-413). ``vcov_from_hessian`` must fall back to it instead of raising.

* **Indefinite information** arises away from a local maximum (e.g. a saddle
  reached before convergence): the Hessian of the penalized negative
  log-likelihood then has a negative eigenvalue, ``second_order_test`` fails, and
  the naive variance on some coordinate is negative. ``standard_errors_from_vcov``
  must clamp that to a finite, non-negative value (here ``0``) rather than emit a
  ``NaN`` from ``sqrt`` of a negative number.

``tests/test_irt_stability.py`` pins the well-identified happy path (positive
definite information -> positive SEs) and a single manually indefinite matrix for
``second_order_test``. These tests pin the two defensive branches that carry the
degenerate cases end to end.
