## 2026-06-29 - [np.load Insecure Deserialization Risk & Assertion Optimization Removal]
**Vulnerability:**
1. `numpy.load()` was used without explicitly specifying `allow_pickle=False`. This could lead to insecure deserialization and arbitrary code execution if a malicious pickle file is loaded (especially critical depending on the environment's NumPy version).
2. `assert` was used for critical control flow (`assert best is not None`). Assertions are stripped out when Python is run with the `-O` optimization flag, potentially leading to undefined behavior and masking errors in production environments.

**Learning:**
Explicitly defining `allow_pickle=False` is a robust defense-in-depth practice. Relying on `assert` for necessary runtime checks is dangerous; standard exceptions like `RuntimeError` should be used instead.

**Prevention:**
- Always add `allow_pickle=False` to `np.load` unless explicitly required and verified.
- Replace critical `assert` statements with `if` condition checks that raise appropriate runtime exceptions.

## 2026-07-06 - [DoS via Unconstrained Array Dimension Allocation]
**Vulnerability:** In `fast_mlsirm/fit.py`, the number of dimensions `n_dims` was calculated using the maximum value provided in user input (`factor_id.max()`). A maliciously crafted large integer in `factor_id` causes `np.zeros((n_persons, n_dims))` to attempt allocating an impossibly large array (e.g. hundreds of GiB), crashing the application via Out-Of-Memory (OOM) and causing a Denial of Service (DoS).
**Learning:** Never trust user input to define unconstrained array dimensions, especially when derived from maximum values within the data.
**Prevention:** Add explicit boundary checks (e.g. `n_dims > n_items`) to ensure derived dimensions remain mathematically sound and computationally feasible before memory allocation.

## 2026-06-30 - [Missing error handling exposing stack traces]
**Vulnerability:** The CLI `main` execution logic was missing a global exception handler. In case of user errors (e.g. invalid arguments or missing files), internal application stack traces were printed directly to `sys.stderr`, leaking internal system states and paths.
**Learning:** Stack traces should never be exposed in production code interfaces unless explicitly enabled (e.g., via `--debug`). Unhandled exceptions in CLI commands lead to poor user experience and leak information.
**Prevention:**
- Always wrap main entry points for CLI applications in a `try...except` block.
- Print generalized, user-friendly error messages (e.g., `Error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory`) instead of leaking internals to stderr.
